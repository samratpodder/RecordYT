RecordYT is a script which records Viewcount and Title and Date Released which can be later used to track the performance of a Youtube Video. The Script RecordYT can work without other files in the repository but it is recommended to atleast have slnrecord.txt and have the digit 0 in it and nothing else(no other characters).Currently the Script PlotData plots a simple graph of viewcount vs time. Figure_1.png shows the increase in viewcount in an time of about 6 hours. 

As an example, i ran the tests on recently released trailer of Dil Bechara(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GODAlxW5Pes) and the data hence collected in available in csv and txt in the repository. 


Warnings:
 The graph is not scaled properly.
 x-axis labels are improper in Figure_1.png
 If you keep the script running in background for a long time it may be suspended(Tab Discarding) or behave  in undefined manner due to latest  implementation to save power,memory  and   computation by both  browsers  and Windows10.

There are many optimizations to be made and many features need to be improved and many features to be added. I am particularly interested in making it a Web-based service and also making an Android Application out of it. Interested people may contact.

This was done in just 06 hours and mainly for entertainment purpose and to do a kind-of-project on what I have recently learnt on Matplotlib and Selenium webDriver.


Hope You will like it ;)
